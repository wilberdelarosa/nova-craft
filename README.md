Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

## Capacitor platforms

The project is already set up with Capacitor so you can build native Android and Electron desktop shells.

1. Build the web assets (`npm run build`).
2. Sync them into the native layers:
	- `npm run cap:sync` keeps every captive platform up to date.
	- `npm run android:sync` pushes web assets and plugins to the Android project.
	- `npm run electron:sync` does the same for the Electron shell.
3. Open each platform for testing:
	```
	npm run android:open
	npm run electron:open
	```
	(Android Studio / your preferred IDE will launch for the selected folder.)

Use a connected Android device or emulator to test the Android build. For Electron, the script launches the generated desktop app and copies the latest web output automatically.

> Tip: When using a USB camera or mobile device during development, open the app on that device’s browser and allow camera permissions to let the barcode scanner find the right feed.
